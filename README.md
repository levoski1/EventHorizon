# EventHorizon: Soroban-to-Web2 Automation Platform

EventHorizon is a decentralized "If-This-Then-That" (IFTTT) platform that listens for specific events emitted by Stellar Soroban smart contracts and triggers real-world Web2 actions like webhooks, Discord notifications, or emails.

## 🚀 How it Works

1.  **If This**: A Soroban smart contract emits an event (e.g., `SwapExecuted`, `LiquidityAdded`).
2.  **Then That**: EventHorizon's worker detects the event and triggers a configured action (e.g., POST to a webhook).

## 📂 Project Structure

-   `/backend`: Node.js/Express server and Soroban event poller worker.
-   `/frontend`: Vite/React dashboard for managing triggers.
-   `/contracts/boilerplate`: Boilerplate Soroban Rust contract for testing.
-   `/contracts/token_vesting`: Secure token vesting contract with linear release and cliff.
-   `/contracts/staking`: Reward-based staking contract with early unstake penalties.
-   `/contracts/task_queue`: On-chain task queue with expiry/trigger logic for off-chain worker automation.


## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB
- Redis (optional, for background job processing - see [REDIS_OPTIONAL.md](backend/REDIS_OPTIONAL.md))
- Rust & Soroban CLI (for contracts)

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both root and subdirectories.
2. Update `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` (e.g., `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org`).
3. Update `MONGO_URI`.

### Running Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start backend
npm run dev:backend

# Start frontend
npm run dev:frontend
```

### API Documentation
- Interactive Swagger UI is available at `/api/docs` when the backend is running.
- Raw OpenAPI JSON is available at `/api/docs/openapi.json`.

### Background Job Processing
EventHorizon uses BullMQ with Redis for reliable background processing of trigger actions:
- **Guaranteed delivery** with automatic retries
- **Concurrency control** for external API calls
- **Job monitoring** via `/api/queue/stats` endpoint
- **Optional**: Works without Redis (falls back to direct execution)
- See [backend/QUEUE_SETUP.md](backend/QUEUE_SETUP.md) for setup instructions
- See [backend/REDIS_OPTIONAL.md](backend/REDIS_OPTIONAL.md) for fallback behavior

## 📦 High-Frequency Event Batching

EventHorizon supports intelligent batching for high-frequency events to improve efficiency and reduce API call overhead:

### Features
- **Window-based batching**: Collect events for a configurable time window (default: 10 seconds)
- **Size-based batching**: Flush batches when reaching a maximum size (default: 50 events)
- **Per-trigger configuration**: Enable/disable batching and customize settings per trigger
- **Error resilience**: Continue processing other events in a batch if one fails (configurable)
- **Array payload format**: Batches are sent as arrays of event payloads

### Configuration
When creating or updating a trigger, include the `batchingConfig` object:

```json
{
  "contractId": "CA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLTJJFC7MGXUA74P7UJVSGZ",
  "eventName": "transfer",
  "actionType": "webhook",
  "actionUrl": "https://api.example.com/webhook",
  "batchingConfig": {
    "enabled": true,
    "windowMs": 10000,        // 10 seconds
    "maxBatchSize": 50,       // Max 50 events per batch
    "continueOnError": true   // Continue if one event fails
  }
}
```

### Batch Payload Format
For webhooks, batches are sent as:

```json
{
  "contractId": "CA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLTJJFC7MGXUA74P7UJVSGZ",
  "eventName": "transfer",
  "batchPayloads": [
    { "event": "payload1", "ledger": 12345 },
    { "event": "payload2", "ledger": 12346 }
  ],
  "batchSize": 2
}
```

For other action types (Discord, Telegram, Email), each event in the batch is processed individually but grouped for efficiency.

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/queue/batches/stats` - Get current batch statistics
- `POST /api/queue/batches/flush` - Manually flush all pending batches

### Monitoring
Use the batch stats endpoint to monitor:
- Number of active batches
- Pending flush timers
- Events per batch and batch age

## 🔐 Audit Logging & Compliance

EventHorizon implements comprehensive audit logging for all trigger operations to ensure compliance and enable debugging:

### Features
- **Complete Operation Tracking**: Logs all CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on triggers
- **Who, What, When, Where**: Captures user identity, operation details, timestamp, and IP address
- **Change Diff Tracking**: Records before/after states and field-level changes for updates
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 hashes ensure log entries cannot be tampered with
- **Admin-Only Access**: Restricted API endpoints with token-based authentication
- **Immutable Logs**: Audit logs are stored in a separate collection with no update/delete capabilities

### Logged Information
Each audit log entry contains:
- **Operation**: CREATE, UPDATE, or DELETE
- **Resource**: Trigger ID and type
- **User Identity**: Hashed identifier based on IP + User-Agent
- **Network Info**: IP address, forwarded headers
- **Timestamp**: Exact time of operation
- **Changes**: Before/after states and field differences
- **Metadata**: Endpoint, HTTP method, session info

### Admin API Endpoints
All audit endpoints require admin authentication via `X-Admin-Token` header:

```
GET /api/admin/audit/logs - Query audit logs with filtering
GET /api/admin/audit/stats - Get audit statistics and analytics
GET /api/admin/audit/resources/{id}/trail - Get complete audit trail for a resource
GET /api/admin/audit/logs/{id}/verify - Verify integrity of specific log
GET /api/admin/audit/verify - Bulk integrity verification
```

### Configuration
Set the admin access token in your environment:

```bash
ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_secure_random_token_here
```

### Security Considerations
- **Token Security**: Use a long, randomly generated token for admin access
- **Network Security**: Restrict admin endpoints to internal networks or VPN
- **Log Integrity**: Regular integrity verification checks
- **Retention**: Implement log rotation and archival policies
- **Access Control**: Audit admin access attempts separately

### Example Queries

**Get recent changes by IP:**
```
GET /api/admin/audit/logs?ipAddress=192.168.1.100&limit=10
```

**Get audit trail for specific trigger:**
```
GET /api/admin/audit/resources/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011/trail
```

**Get daily activity statistics:**
```
GET /api/admin/audit/stats?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31
```

## ⏱️ Task Queue Contract

The `task_queue` contract (`/contracts/task_queue`) provides an on-chain queue of scheduled tasks that an off-chain worker monitors and executes.

### How It Works

1. A user calls `register` with an opaque `payload` (e.g., a webhook URL or encoded call) and a `trigger_at` timestamp.
2. The contract stores the task and emits a `registered` event with the full payload.
3. The off-chain worker watches for `registered` / `bumped` events and waits until `trigger_at`.
4. Once due, anyone (typically the worker) calls `trigger`, which emits a `triggered` event with the full payload for the worker to act on.

### Storage Design

Tasks are stored in **persistent storage keyed by task ID** (a simple mapping). A single instance-storage counter tracks the next ID. This is more gas-efficient than a linked list for this use case because the off-chain worker drives iteration via events — the contract never needs to traverse the queue.

### Contract Functions

| Function | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `register(owner, payload, trigger_at) → u64` | `owner` | Register a new task; returns its ID |
| `bump(task_id, new_trigger_at)` | `owner` | Extend the trigger time of a pending task |
| `cancel(task_id)` | `owner` | Cancel a pending task |
| `trigger(task_id)` | anyone | Mark a due task as triggered (emits full payload) |
| `get_task(task_id) → Task` | — | Read a task record |
| `next_id() → u64` | — | Read the next task ID counter |

### Events

Every state-changing function emits an event with the **full `Task` struct** as the value, so the off-chain worker never needs to query storage separately.

| Topic symbol | When emitted |
|---|---|
| `registered` | New task created |
| `bumped` | Trigger time extended |
| `cancelled` | Task cancelled by owner |
| `triggered` | Task executed (worker should act on `payload`) |

### Task Struct

```rust
pub struct Task {
    pub id: u64,
    pub owner: Address,
    pub payload: Bytes,   // arbitrary bytes — encode whatever the worker needs
    pub trigger_at: u64,  // ledger timestamp
    pub status: TaskStatus, // Pending | Triggered | Cancelled
}
```

### Example Usage

```bash
# Register a task due in 1 hour (ledger timestamp + 3600)
soroban contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- register \
  --owner <YOUR_ADDRESS> \
  --payload <HEX_PAYLOAD> \
  --trigger_at <TIMESTAMP>

# Bump the deadline
soroban contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- bump \
  --task_id 0 --new_trigger_at <LATER_TIMESTAMP>

# Trigger once due (called by the off-chain worker)
soroban contract invoke --id <CONTRACT_ID> -- trigger --task_id 0
```

## 🧪 Testing with the Boilerplate Contract
1. Deploy the contract in `/contracts`.
2. Copy the Contract ID.
3. Add a new trigger in the dashboard using the Contract ID and event name `test_event`.
4. Invoke the `trigger_event` function on the contract.
5. Watch the backend logs/webhook for the triggered action!
